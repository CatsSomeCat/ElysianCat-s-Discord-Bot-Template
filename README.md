**ElysianCat's Discord Bot Template** is a lightweight, highly customizable template designed for building Discord bots.

While it doesn't come with pre-built features like moderation or entertainment commands, it provides a robust foundation with advanced logging, utilities, and a modular structure.

This makes it perfect for developers who want to create a bot tailored to their specific needs without starting from scratch.

---

## üåü Features

- **Advanced Logging**: Configurable multi-channel logging with JSON configuration.
- **Environment Management**: Secure token handling with `.env` files.
- **Dev/Prod Ready**: Built-in support for different environments.
- **Utilities**: A collection of useful utility functions and decorators to simplify development.
- **Extensible**: Designed to be easily extended with new features and integrations.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or newer.
- A Discord bot token (obtained from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).
- `discord.py` library installed (`pip install discord.py`).

---

## ‚ö° Quick Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/CatsSomeCat/ElysianCat-s-Discord-Bot-Template.git"
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ElysianCat-Discord-Bot-Template
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt # If using pip
   ```

   ```bash
   poetry install # If using poetry
   ```

4. Run the bot:
    ```bash
   python main.py
    ```

---

> **Note**: Depending on your system configuration, you may need to replace `python` with the appropriate Python command, such as `py`, `python3`, `python3.13`, or another version-specific command. To check which Python versions are installed, run:
> ```bash
> python --version
> python3 --version
> ```
> Ensure you use the correct command that corresponds to the required Python version (3.13 or higher) for this project.

## ü§ñ Configure the Bot

1. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Rename `.example.env` to `.env`.
   - Add your Discord bot token, application ID, and other necessary details in the `.env` file.

2. **Logging Configuration:**
   - Rename `logging_config.example.json` to `logging_config.json`.
   - Customize the logging settings in the `logging_config.json` file to suit your needs.

3. **Bot Configuration:**
   - Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`.
   - Modify the settings in the `config.json` file to configure the bot according to your preferences.

---

## üîß Configuration

Customize `logging_config.json` to tailor the logging behavior to your needs. Here's what you can configure:

1. **File Logging Paths**: Specify where log files are saved.
2. **Log Levels**: Set different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
3. **Formatting Styles**: Customize the format of log messages (e.g., timestamp, log level, message).
4. **Rotation Policies**: Configure log file rotation based on size, time or even both simultaneously.

### Custom Formatters

1. **`simple`**: Basic log format for file logging.
2. **`colorized`**: Colorized log format for console output.
3. **`discord_embed`**: Formats logs into Discord embed messages.
4. **`JSONLFormatter` (unused)**: Formats logs into JSON Lines (JSONL) format.

### Custom Handlers

1. **`console`**: Outputs logs to the console.
2. **`file`**: Writes logs to a file with rotation support.
3. **`discord`**: Sends logs to a Discord channel via a webhook.

### Custom Implementation

The bot includes custom handlers and formatters located in `logging_.handlers` and `logging._formatters`:

---

```python
__all__ = (
    "DualRotatingHandler",
    "JSONLFileHandler",
    "DiscordWebHookHandler",
)
```

---

```python
__all__ = (
    "ColorizedFormatter",
    "JSONLFormatter",
    "DiscordEmbedLoggingFormatter",
)
```

---

### Example `logging_config.json` File:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "disable_existing_loggers": false,

    "": {
      "handlers": ["file_handler", "console_handler"],
      "level": "INFO",
      "propagate": true
    }
  }
}
```
